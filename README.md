# Anderegg_EcolLet_IntraspecificLES
Code for analyses contained in Anderegg LDL, Berner LT, Badgley G, Sethi ML, Law BE, HilleRisLamber J (2018) Within-species patterns challenge our understanding of the Leaf Economics Spectrum. Ecology Letters. 27:1 https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12945

This code illustrates the creation of the Derived Datasets used in this analysis, as well as the analyses themselves and plotting of results. The derived dataset "SlopesAndCorrelations_alltaxa_clean.csv" is included in this repository, and contains the results from the analysis of SMA slopes, correlations, and null model simulations for all within-taxon data subsets. This file can be used to replicate the main findings of the paper (shown in Figs 2-4).
